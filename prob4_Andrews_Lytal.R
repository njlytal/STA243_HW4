# *** B ***
# Use a permutation test to compare the three different treatments.
# (More on process below)
# Merge the data sets to form one large sample,
# then resample into three new groups of equal size to their
# initial groups by drawing randomly without replacement from 
# the large sample.
# If the groups are equivalent, then the means of the three groups
# should be similar (despite being randomly sampled from all distributions),
# while if the means are quite different, the groups must not be similar.
